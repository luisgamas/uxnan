# FOR-DEV — uxnan-bridge

Deferred developer work for the bridge. Each item has a greppable `FOR-DEV:`
marker at its site in the code. (Distinct from `FOR-HUMAN.md`, which tracks assets
only a human can provide.)

> **How to run/validate everything** (automated tests, real-mobile E2EE interop,
> adapter wiring, contract re-checks) is in [`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md).
> Each deferred item below says what to build; that doc says how to test it.
> Install/config/agents/deploy docs are alongside it in [`docs/`](docs/).

## Plug-and-play "install and use" — remaining sequence
The goal is: install on the PC, log into the agents you want, point the phone at a
folder, and go. Tracked items, in order:
1. **Directory browsing** — DONE (bridge `workspace/browseDirs` **and** the mobile
   browser UI: a `WorkspaceBrowserSheet` with root picker / breadcrumb / git-repo
   badges wired into the new-conversation flow → `thread/start { cwd }`). See
   Handlers → Plug-and-play below.
2. **Autostart / `install-service`** — DONE (`install-service`/`uninstall-service`
   run the bridge at logon per platform; see Daemon lifecycle).
3. **Packaging / publish** — bundle `@uxnan/shared` (or publish it first) and ship
   the bridge as `npm i -g uxnan-bridge` / a single binary (see Packaging). NEXT.
Remote access (off-LAN) needs a hosted relay; **LAN-only works today with zero
hosting** (the phone connects directly to the bridge on the same network).

## Transport & connectivity
- [x] **Secure transport / E2EE handshake** — `src/transport/` (Phase 2). Relay
      `mac` client + LAN server, handshake, AES-256-GCM channel; interoperable
      byte-for-byte with the mobile app.
- [x] **Relay package** — `relay/` builds and is in the root workspaces (Phase 2).
- [x] **Bridge → phone notifications** (Phase 2b) — `SessionRegistry` +
      `bridge.notify()`; offline messages buffered via `OutboundMessageBuffer`.
- [x] **Stable pairing session** — the pairing `sessionId` is persisted to
      `~/.uxnan/pairing-session.json` (`src/bridge.ts`, `daemon-state.ts`) and
      reused across restarts instead of a fresh UUID each boot.
- [x] **Relay connection survives phone reconnects** — `connectRelay`
      (`src/bridge.ts`) runs a background loop: serve one phone session, then
      immediately re-arm on the relay so trusted-reconnect works without re-scanning.
- [x] **Direct LAN/Tailscale addressing (relay optional)** —
      `src/transport/local-hosts.ts` advertises the bridge's non-internal IPv4s
      (LAN + Tailscale `100.x`) as `hosts` in the pairing QR; `relay` is optional in
      the contract; `relayEnabled` config skips the relay for a pure direct setup.
      LAN-direct is the primary path, Tailscale the recommended remote option (no
      hosting), relay optional. See `docs/connectivity.md`. **Next steps:**
        - **Mobile (uxnanmobile branch):** consume `hosts` — try the direct
          addresses first, fall back to `relay`; tolerate a missing `relay` (the
          current Dart parser requires it). This is the half that makes direct/
          Tailscale actually used by the app.
        - **Bind the LAN server to chosen interface(s)** — today it binds all
          interfaces (good for Tailscale; advertise virtual-NIC IPs too). Optionally
          let the user restrict which interfaces are served/advertised.
- [ ] **Seq-based catch-up on reconnect** — `src/transport/server-handshake.ts`.
      Read `clientHello.resumeState.lastAppliedBridgeOutboundSeq` and replay
      envelopes with a greater `seq`. **Blocked:** the mobile `clientHello` does
      not send `resumeState` yet — coordinate with the mobile side first.
- [ ] **Key rotation / keyEpoch advance** — blocked on a mobile trigger.

## Identity & security
- [x] **OS-keychain SecretStore** (Phase 3) — `src/keyring-secret-store.ts` via
      `@napi-rs/keyring`, with in-memory fallback. NOTE: on headless Linux without
      a running Secret Service it falls back to in-memory (no persistence) — wire a
      CI/service alternative there before relying on persistence on Linux.

## Handlers
- [x] **Git** (Phase 4) — `src/git/` + `src/handlers/git-handler.ts`.
- [x] **Workspace** reads/list/applyPatch (Phase 4) — `src/workspace/`.
- [x] **Workspace checkpoints** (Phase 4b) — `src/workspace/checkpoint-service.ts`
      (full-tree snapshot via temp index + `commit-tree`, anchored ref + metadata).
      Follow-ups:
        - ☑ **True restore** — `apply` now deletes files created after the
          checkpoint AND restores snapshot contents (recreating deleted, overwriting
          modified), so the worktree matches the snapshot exactly. Extras are found
          by snapshotting the current tree into a temp index (HEAD + `add -A`) and
          diffing snapshot → now; worktree-only, never removes gitignored files.
          Full parity with the mobile `AiChangeSet` revert. **Mobile linkage:** no
          uxnanmobile change needed — `workspace/applyCheckpoint` is unchanged on
          the wire; verify on-device that a revert removes files the agent created.
        - ☑ **Prune/GC** — each `capture` prunes checkpoints beyond
          `checkpointMaxPerProject` (default 25, per `cwd`) and/or older than
          `checkpointTtlDays` (default 0 = off), deleting the `refs/uxnan/checkpoints/*`
          anchor + the `checkpoints.json` entry. See `docs/configuration.md`.
        - ☐ checkpoints require at least one commit (no HEAD → `-32003`); consider
          supporting checkpoints on an unborn branch if a use case appears.
- [x] **Thread/turn** (Phase 5) — `src/handlers/thread-context-handler.ts` +
      `src/conversation/thread-store.ts` + `src/agents/agent-manager.ts`.
- [x] **Plug-and-play directory browsing (bridge side)** — `workspace/browseDirs`
      (`src/workspace/browse-service.ts` + `workspace-handler.ts`) lets the phone
      browse sub-directories under a configured base root (`config.browseRoots`,
      falling back to `workspaceRoots` → home), mark which are git repos, and pick
      ANY directory as a thread's cwd (`thread/start { cwd }`) — no per-project
      pre-config. Root-confined via `resolveWithinRoot`. `project/list`/`resolve`
      (the manual `workspaceRoots` list) stay as-is for explicitly configured
      projects. **Status / next steps:**
        - **Mobile UI** — DONE (uxnanmobile): `WorkspaceBrowserSheet` calls
          `workspace/browseDirs`, shows the root picker + git-repo badges, navigates
          with `parent`/`dirs`, and opens a thread on the chosen `cwd` (resolved to
          a project via `project/resolve`). Remaining: on-device verification.
        - **Hard agent confinement** (optional): browseDirs confines the *phone API*,
          not the agent *process*. True read-confinement of the agent to the chosen
          subtree needs OS sandboxing (container/chroot) — out of MVP scope; for now
          writes are bounded by each agent's sandbox posture (Codex `workspace-write`,
          Claude `acceptEdits`). See FOR-HUMAN.md.
- [x] **Per-project agent selection from `AgentConfig`** — a `projectAgents:
      AgentConfig[]` config (keyed by each entry's absolute `cwd`) pins a
      project's default `agentId`/`model`. `ProjectRegistry` consumes it
      (`agentConfigFor(cwd)` + the pin surfaced on `Project.agentId`/`model`), and
      `thread/start` falls back to the pinned agent → global `defaultAgent` when
      the phone omits `agentId`; the pinned model applies only when the resolved
      agent matches the pin. **Still not consumed:** `AgentConfig.binaryPath` /
      `extraArgs` (per-project binary/arg overrides) — wire them into the adapter
      spawn if a use case appears. **Mobile linkage (no uxnanmobile change
      required):** `project/list`/`resolve` now return `agentId`/`model` on each
      `Project`; the phone MAY pre-select them in `NewConversationSheet` (today it
      lets the user pick) — purely optional UX. Server-side resolution already
      makes omitting them work.
- [x] **Thread management** — `thread/rename` / `thread/archive` /
      `thread/unarchive` / `thread/delete` (`thread-context-handler.ts` +
      `thread-store.ts`, contracted in `@uxnan/shared`). Rename/archive/unarchive
      return the updated `Thread`; delete removes the thread + its turns (unknown
      id → `-32008`). The mobile app already called these best-effort; they now
      persist on the bridge so the change survives a phone reinstall / second
      device.
      **Mobile linkage (no uxnanmobile code change needed):** the phone already
      calls all four local-first and degrades gracefully, so nothing new is
      required there. To VALIDATE on-device once a live bridge is reachable: after
      archive/rename a `thread/list` re-sync should reflect the new status/title,
      and a deleted thread must not reappear — confirm the mobile `thread/list`
      parser maps `status: 'archived'`. The bridge now RETURNS the updated
      `Thread` on rename/archive/unarchive; the phone currently ignores it (keeps
      its optimistic copy) — optional future reconcile against the returned value.
- [◑] **Account/auth** — `src/handlers/account-handler.ts` + `src/account-status.ts`.
      **`auth/status` DONE (sanitized, per-agent):** takes `{ agentId }`, returns a
      sanitized `AuthStatus` (never tokens — login is detected by auth-file
      EXISTENCE only, contents never read; unmapped agent → availability; unknown
      agent → `-32602`). **Still deferred:** `auth/login`/`auth/logout` (driving a
      CLI's interactive login/logout flow) remain stubs — and an authoritative
      `requiresLogin` would run the CLI's own `whoami`/auth command instead of the
      file-existence heuristic (slower, per-CLI). **Mobile linkage:** the spec's
      `authStatusProvider` already calls `getAuthStatus(agentId)` per the active
      project's agent; the bridge now answers it. On-device: verify the
      requires-login banner appears when the agent CLI is logged out on the PC.
- [x] **Notifications** — `src/handlers/notifications-handler.ts` +
      `src/push/push-service.ts`. `notifications/register|update|unregister` wired;
      registers the token with the relay and pushes on turn-end (gated by
      `config.push*` + Firebase creds on the relay). **Persistence + multi-session
      DONE:** registrations are keyed by relay `sessionId` and persisted to
      `~/.uxnan/push-state.json` (atomic), loaded at startup via
      `PushService.load()`, so background push survives a bridge restart WITHOUT
      the phone re-registering (the relay keeps its own sessionId→token map; the
      bridge only needs `sessionId` + `notificationSecret` to call `/push/notify`).
      A turn-end pushes to **every** registered phone, so multiple paired devices
      each get background push. Remaining follow-ups:
        - `register`/`updatePreferences`/`unregister` act on the *active* session
          (exact with `maxConcurrentSessions: 1`); to target a specific phone when
          several sessions are concurrent, thread per-request session identity
          through the router to the handler. **FOR-DEV.**
        - prune registrations for devices removed via `bridge/removeTrustedDevice`
          (today they linger until `unregister`/overwrite) — wire trust-removal to
          drop the matching push registration.
        - **Mobile linkage:** no uxnanmobile change needed — the phone already
          calls `notifications/register` on connect. To VALIDATE end-to-end needs
          the Firebase/APNs creds (FOR-HUMAN) + a real device; confirm a turn-end
          push arrives while backgrounded, and still arrives after restarting the
          bridge (without reopening the app).
- [ ] **(OPT-IN — explicit developer request ONLY) Direct FCM from the bridge,
      push without the relay.** Today background push **requires a running relay**:
      the bridge holds no FCM credentials and `POST`s `/push/notify` to the relay,
      which owns the Firebase service account and calls FCM. This is intentional —
      it keeps the bridge credential-free and the relay optional for *everything
      except* background push (foreground local notifications already work
      relay-free; see `relay/docs/push-notifications.md` → "Do I need the relay?").
      If — and only if — a developer explicitly asks for background push in a pure
      relay-less (LAN/Tailscale-direct) setup, add an alternative `PushSender` in
      the bridge that calls FCM directly via `firebase-admin` using a local
      `UXNAN_FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`, selected when `relayEnabled === false`. **Do NOT
      build this by default**: the relay-based path stays the default so the bridge
      ships with no push secrets. Implement strictly on request.
- [ ] **Desktop** — `src/handlers/desktop-handler.ts` (embedded mode IPC).
- [x] **bridge/removeTrustedDevice** — `src/handlers/bridge-control-handler.ts`.
      Revokes trust (`ctx.trustStore.remove`) and drops any live session/sink
      (`sessions.remove` + `sessionRegistry.unregister`) so a removed device is
      both untrusted and disconnected now. Idempotent (removing an absent device
      is not an error). `bridge/trustedDevices` now reads through `ctx.trustStore`
      too. **Mobile linkage:** the uxnanmobile "Remove device" card action is
      still DEFERRED (its `FOR-DEV.md` → *Threads list → Remove device*); the
      bridge side is now ready, so when that UI lands it just calls this method
      (`{ deviceId }`) after deleting the local `TrustedDevice` + threads. No
      further bridge work needed.
- [x] **bridge/status `relayConnected`** — reflects the real relay connection.
      `BridgeContext.relayConnected()` reads the live relay-serve state (the
      `relayState.connected` holder in `src/bridge.ts`, true while a relay
      connection is serving a phone), so the `bridge/status` handler no longer
      hard-codes `false`. **Mobile linkage:** the phone's `bridge/status` parser
      already consumes `relayConnected`; verify on-device that it flips true while
      a relay session is live and false on LAN-only/idle.

## Agent adapters
- [x] **Framework + reference** (Phase 5) — `ProcessAgentAdapter` (generic CLI
      stdio driver) + working `EchoAgentAdapter`; `AgentManager` orchestration.
- [x] **OpenCode** (MVP) — `src/adapters/opencode-adapter.ts`. WIRED and the
      bridge's default agent. Spawns `opencode run --format json` per turn,
      parses the NDJSON event stream, keeps the OpenCode `sessionID` per thread
      for `--session` continuity, runs in the thread's cwd. Picks the model from
      `service` (per-turn) → thread.model → `config.agents.opencode.model`.
      Binary resolved by `resolve-opencode.ts` (native `opencode.exe` on Windows).
- [x] **Per-thread agent selection** — `thread/start { agentId, model, cwd }`
      persists the choice; `turn/send` drives the thread's agent in its cwd.
      `agent/list` exposes registered agents + capabilities + availability.
- [x] **Agent model discovery** — `agent/models` now returns a **structured
      `AgentModel[]`** (`id`/`displayName`/`description?`/`version?`/`isDefault?`),
      account-aware per agent: OpenCode runs `opencode models`; **Codex** drives
      `codex app-server` (`initialize` → `model/list`, the desktop app's source)
      with a `~/.codex/config.toml` fallback; **Claude Code** exposes the stable
      `opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku` aliases (labelled "(latest)") plus any concrete
      versions pinned in `agents.claude-code.models`. The concrete model an alias
      resolves to is reported per-run via the `stream/model/resolved` notification
      (`model_resolved` adapter event).
- [x] **Per-turn token usage** — `stream/turn/completed` now carries
      `usage { tokens, contextWindow? }`: Claude parses the `result` event's
      `usage` and maps the tier context window (Opus/Sonnet 1M, Haiku 200K);
      Codex sums `turn.completed.usage` (no window in exec mode); `AgentManager`
      forwards it. Lets the phone show a context-usage indicator.
- [x] **Change a thread's model mid-conversation** — `thread/setModel`
      (`ThreadStore.setModel` + `thread-context-handler.ts`).

### Adding the next agent (recipe — do these one by one)
The OpenCode adapter is the template for any "one-shot per-turn CLI" agent:
1. Run the real CLI by hand once and capture a turn's machine-readable stream
   (`<cli> ... --json|--format json`). **Watch for stdin:** OpenCode hangs on an
   open stdin pipe — spawn with `stdio:['ignore','pipe','pipe']`.
2. Copy `opencode-adapter.ts`; adjust the args builder (`run/exec`, model flag,
   session/continue flag, cwd flag) and `parseLine` for that CLI's event shape.
   Keep `shell:false` and pass the prompt as an argv element (no injection).
3. Register it in `startBridge` with display metadata + availability.
- [x] **Codex** — `src/adapters/codex-adapter.ts`. WIRED via `codex exec --json`
      (`exec resume <thread_id>` for continuity, `-m` model, `-C` cwd, always
      `--skip-git-repo-check`). Parses the JSONL stream (`thread.started` /
      `item.completed` `agent_message` / `turn.completed` / `turn.failed`), keeps
      the `thread_id` per thread. Sandbox posture is configurable via
      `agents['codex'].permissionMode` (default `acceptEdits` → `-s workspace-write`;
      also `default` → `-s read-only`, `bypassPermissions` →
      `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`). Binary resolved by
      `resolve-codex.ts` (npm `@openai/codex/bin/codex.js` via node → PATH).
      Turns use the one-shot `codex exec` entry point. **Model discovery (done):**
      `codex exec` has no enumerate command, so `listModels()` briefly spawns
      `codex app-server` and runs the `initialize` → `model/list` JSON-RPC
      handshake (account-aware, the desktop app's source), falling back to
      `~/.codex/config.toml`. `turn.completed.usage` is parsed for the context
      indicator.
- [x] **Claude Code** — `src/adapters/claude-adapter.ts`. WIRED via
      `claude -p --output-format stream-json --verbose --include-partial-messages`
      (`--resume <session_id>`, `--model <alias|id>`). Parses the JSONL stream
      (`system`/`stream_event` `text_delta`/`assistant`/`result`), keeps the
      `session_id` per thread, runs in the thread's cwd. Headless permission
      posture is configurable via `agents['claude-code'].permissionMode`
      (default `acceptEdits`; also `default` / `bypassPermissions`). Binary
      resolved by `resolve-claude.ts` (native `~/.local/bin/claude[.exe]` → npm
      `cli.js` via node → PATH). **Model discovery (done):** `listModels()`
      exposes the `opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku` aliases (labelled "(latest)") plus any
      concrete versions pinned in `agents.claude-code.models`; the version an
      alias resolves to is captured from the `system/init` event and emitted as
      `model_resolved`. `result.usage` is parsed (with the tier context window)
      for the context indicator.
- [ ] **Gemini CLI** — capture its non-interactive JSON stream first. New scaffold.
- [ ] **JSONL history fallback** (`session-jsonl-history`) — read agent session
      JSONL/SQLite from disk for `turn/list` when the runtime has no fresh data
      (§5.8.8). Needs each agent's real on-disk format.
- [ ] Later: pi-agent, Aider.

## Daemon lifecycle & ops
- [x] **Single-instance lock + `stop`** (Phase 3) — `src/lock-file.ts`,
      `src/cli.ts` (`bridge.lock` + SIGTERM).
- [x] **`install-service` / `uninstall-service` autostart** — `src/service-installer.ts`
      + `src/cli.ts`. Runs the bridge at logon **as the logged-in user, never
      elevated** (`node <cli.js> start`, works global-install or dev). Per platform:
        - **Windows:** a **Task Scheduler** logon task (`schtasks /SC ONLOGON /RL
          LIMITED`); **falls back to a hidden Startup-folder `.vbs`** when Task
          Scheduler is denied (restricted accounts/policy) — no admin, no console
          window. Validated end-to-end on Windows.
        - **macOS:** a per-user **LaunchAgent** (`RunAtLoad` + `KeepAlive`).
        - **Linux:** a **systemd `--user`** unit (`loginctl enable-linger` tip
          printed). `buildServicePlan` is pure (unit-tested per platform).
      Follow-ups (FOR-DEV): **relay autostart** (only needed for remote/off-LAN —
      LAN-only needs no relay); bind the LAN server to the LAN iface only.
- [x] **File logging** (Phase 7) — `src/logger.ts` `createFileLogger`
      (`~/.uxnan/logs/bridge-YYYY-MM-DD.log`, daily rotation + secret redaction).
      Follow-up: size-based rotation + retention/pruning of old log files.
- [ ] **Version** — `src/version.ts` (source from package.json at build).

## Packaging (Phase 7 — npm publish readiness)
- [x] `bin`, `files`, `engines`, `repository`, `prepublishOnly: tsc` set on all
      three packages.
- [ ] **Before `npm publish`:** publish `@uxnan/shared` first, then change the
      bridge/relay dep `"@uxnan/shared": "*"` → the real `"^0.x"` version (the `*`
      workspace spec does NOT resolve from the public registry). Same for the
      bridge's `"uxnan-relay": "*"` devDependency (drop it or pin it; it's only
      used by the e2e test).
- [ ] Verify a packed install end-to-end: `npm pack` each package, then
      `npm install -g ./uxnan-bridge-*.tgz` and run `uxnan-bridge qr`.
- [ ] Ensure the `scripts/*.sh` keep their executable bit when published
      (npm preserves mode; verify on a packed tarball).

## Relay hardening
- [x] **Per-IP rate limiting** (Phase 3) — `relay/src/relay-server.ts`.
- [ ] **Pairing-code resolution** (`/trusted-session/resolve`) and **multi-session
      `mac` registration** — need protocol/mobile coordination (§5.10.1).
- [ ] **Push endpoints** (`/push/*`, APNs/FCM) — Phase 6.

## Contracts verified
- [x] **Pairing QR encoding** — `@uxnan/shared` now emits Base64 JSON matching the
      mobile `PairingPayload.fromQrString` (Phase 3).
